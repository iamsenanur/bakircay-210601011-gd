210601011-210601051

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the materials and instructions for a two-part game development assignment in Unity. Students will progressively build a simplified 3D matching game, divided into two phases: a midterm and a final exam.

### Assets
All necessary models, animations, and UI assets required for this project are provided in this repository.






- **Repository Structure:** Create a repository with a `README.md` and `.gitignore` file for Unity. Include the Unity project files organized in standard folders (Assets, Scenes, Scripts, etc.).




## Midterm Project (Due Date: 22 Nov 2024, Friday 23:59)
In the midterm phase, students will:

1. **Basic Game Setup:**
 - **Game Area:** Set up a central area where 3D objects are scattered randomly.
 - **Placement Area:** Create a circular placement area at the bottom of the screen where players can place objects.

2. **Object Interaction:**
 - **Object Movement:** Implement functionality for players to pick up and drag objects using touch or mouse input.
 - **Object Placement:** Ensure players can place only one object in the designated placement area at a time.
