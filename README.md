# Bakırçay Fall-2024 Game Development

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the materials and instructions for a two-part game development assignment in Unity. Students will progressively build a simplified 3D matching game, divided into two phases: a midterm and a final exam.

### Assets
All necessary models, animations, and UI assets required for this project are provided in this repository.






- **Repository Structure:** Create a repository with a `README.md` and `.gitignore` file for Unity. Include the Unity project files organized in standard folders (Assets, Scenes, Scripts, etc.).

- **Gameplay Screen Capture:** Capture a short screen recording of your game in action, showing the required functionality. Place the recording in the `README.md` file under the "Gameplay Preview" section (see example below). The capture should clearly show the game area, placement area, and UI elements.



## Midterm Project (Due Date: 22 Nov 2024, Friday 23:59)
In the midterm phase, students will:

1. **Basic Game Setup:**
 - **Game Area:** Set up a central area where 3D objects are scattered randomly.
 - **Placement Area:** Create a circular placement area at the bottom of the screen where players can place objects.

2. **Object Interaction:**
 - **Object Movement:** Implement functionality for players to pick up and drag objects using touch or mouse input.
 - **Object Placement:** Ensure players can place only one object in the designated placement area at a time.

  **Bonus (Optional):**	
  - Additional creative gameplay features, visual polish, or UI enhancements beyond midterm requirements. The bonus points are optional and awarded for extra effort, such as adding subtle effects, animations, or aesthetic improvements.
